[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python warden.py"
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

The issue was the backticks around `on_failure`. TOML doesn't use backticks - just use plain text for string values.

## Actually, Simplest Solution - Skip railway.toml

You don't actually need `railway.toml` at all! Railway can auto-detect Python projects. Just keep these two files:

### 1. `requirements.txt`:
```
discord.py>=2.3.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

### 2. `Procfile`:
```
worker: python warden.py
